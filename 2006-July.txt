First, I'de like to say this looks like a very interesting project,
however, I'm having problems actually using.  I seem to have found every
piece of documentation apart from one that actually walks you through an
example.  Can anybody help?

Met vriendelijke groet, Kind regards,

Hi Richard,

When running quick demos and manual functional tests,  I tend to use
the python client for HJB, PyHjb <http://hjb.python-hosting.com>, and
ActiveMQ <http://www.activemq.org>.  What messaging product are you
using ?

I'm not sure precisely what info you are looking for for, but the
following list of URLs might help:

    Instructions for downloading PyHJB:
http://hjb.python-hosting.com/wiki/GettingStarted

    There are simple code samples for using PyHJB:
http://hjb.python-hosting.com/wiki/ExampleCode

    The PyHjb distribution comes with a number of functions that
demonstrate the use of python to communicate with a JMS server via
HJB.  Information about these demos is available here:
http://hjb.python-hosting.com/wiki/WorkingDemos.

    The instructions for configuring several different messaging
providers  (ActiveMQ, SwiftMQ, JBoss Messaging and Websphere MQ) for
use with HJB are included in the PyHJB distribution, and they can be
accessed online via Trac:

    ActiveMQ:
http://hjb.python-hosting.com/file/trunk/samples/data/activemq/testing-activemq.rst?rev=44

    SwiftMQ:

Hi,

Ok, I'm trying to use you project via a web front end that deals with
various queues/topics for monitoring & testing.  So far I have achived
the following:

1) Build the HJB War file for WEBLOGIC and deployed it to Tomcat
2) Started Tomcat and get:
2006-07-17 09:47:59,674 INFO  [http-8080-Processor24] [HJBServlet] Hello
- I've successfully started HJB root!
2006-07-17 09:47:59,674 INFO  [HJB Root Command Runner]
[JMSCommandRunner] JMSCommandRunner in thread HJB Root Command Runner is
now active

However in the log of tomcat I get:

INFO: Container
org.apache.catalina.core.ContainerBase.[Catalina].[localhost].[/hjb-wl]
has not been started
17-Jul-2006 09:47:34 org.apache.catalina.loader.WebappClassLoader
validateJarFile
INFO:
validateJarFile(D:\apache-tomcat-5.5.16\webapps\hjb-wl\WEB-INF\lib\weblo
gic.jar) - jar not loaded. See Servlet Spec 2.3, section 9.7.2.
Offending class: javax/servlet/Servlet.class
17-Jul-2006 09:47:40 org.apache.catalina.core.StandardContext start
INFO: Container
org.apache.catalina.core.ContainerBase.[Catalina].[localhost].[/hjb-wl]
has already been started

I'm not sure if this is a problem.

3) From here I tried to construct some URI's that would register a
provider e.g.

http://localhost:8080/hjb-wl/hjb/myprovider/register?java.naming.factory
.initial=weblogic.jndi.WLInitialContextFactory&java.naming.provider.url=
t3://127.0.0.1:7501

However the format of the URL (especially the parameters) was not clear
to me.  Each time I send a request I'd get the following line in the log
file:

2006-07-17 11:07:48,240 INFO  [http-8080-Processor22] [HJBApplication]
Could not match request [/weblogic/connectionFactory]

4) I saw the example files below but a) I've no experience with Python
b) I don't have a huge amount of time to go through the Python Lib.


What I was looking for were some simple step by step examples of URL's
for POSTS and GETS that would enable me to send a message to a Queue.

Regards
Richard Jewson

I'm not sure about this either.  If the weblogic.jar file is really
not loaded, it will not be possible to find the
weblogic.jndi.WLInitialContextFactory class.  However, since this
error occurs during servlet startup, it may not be a problem - it is
probably Tomcat rejecting a version of the Servlet class found in the
weblogic.jar, which is the correct thing to do.

<comment>
The reason this does not work is because provider registration needs a
POST request. See
<http://hjb.berlios.de/command-list.html> and
<http://hjb.berlios.de/register-provider.html>
After this, no other requests will work, because the provider has not
been registered successfully.

<comment>
Can you post some of the URL's you are trying at the moment in
addition to the registration one?

This looks as if you're sending a request to URL

http://localhost:8080/hjb-wl/weblogic/connectionFactory

and the servlet is not finding the anything.

This would be the case, as "weblogic" is not registered as a provider.

Thanks, that's a really good idea.  I'll do it, and put it on the
website later today.

If you need this urgently, send me a copy of the hjb WAR file you've
created, plus any pertinent weblogic configuration details (e.g.,
connection factory or destination names), and I'll send you series of
URLs with the corresponding request methods that should allow you to
send a message.

Hi,

Thanks for the reply:

1) I misread the GET/POST thing for registering providers call - sorry
about that.  On the page <http://hjb.berlios.de/register-provider.html>
it talks about multiple parameters.  I guess these are thing like:

java.naming.factory.initial=weblogic.jndi.WLInitialContextFactory
java.naming.provider.url=t3://127.0.0.1:7501
java.naming.security.principal=admin
java.naming.security.credentials=password

What format/parameters names do you use in the post?

2) I've attached my .WAR file (without the 37Mb weblogic.jar)

Once I have a working example I'd be happy to write up my install as
another perspective.  I'll also propably write some simple web pages in
JSTL that create a session, connect and send messages - I'll send that
to you as well.

Unfortunately, it does - HJB assumes JMS 1.1 compliance, and the
errors below are consistent with the creation of JMS1.0.2 objects that
don't implement the JMS 1.1 interrfaces:

javax.jms.ConnectionFactory  and javax.jms.Destination

These do not exist prior to JMS1.1, hence you would get ClassCast
Exceptions on registering pre-1.1 Topics, Queues and
ConnectionFactorys.

Yup,

Sorry, that's my fault.  You don't need to specify the hostname when
you use the destination-url parameter, so Step 6 should have been:

<snip>
6) POST
http://localhost:8080/hjb-wl/hjb/wl-provider/a_url_encoded_wl_connection_factory_jndi_name/connection-0/session-0/create-producer

with parameter

destination-url=/hjb-wl/hjb/wl-provider/destination/a_url_encoded_wl_destination_name
</snip>

I assume you've changed to the Weblogic configuration so that you are
now using JMS1.1 ?
