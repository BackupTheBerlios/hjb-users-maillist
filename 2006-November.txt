Subject: [Hjb-users] HJB 0.9.1 released
Message-ID: <336ade8a0611251615v595a829ag55ba3fb35b1b1e64@mail.gmail.com>

HJB <http://hjb.berlios.de>, the HTTP JMS Bridge, provides a REST
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST> version of the JMS
<http://java.sun.com/products/jms> API.  This REST API allows programs
in languages other than Java to access **ANY** messaging systems that
provide a JMS interface.

HJB 0.9.0 was released last week, but HJB 0.9.1 has been released very
quickly afterwards to fix an important bug.

The important features in these 0.9.x releases are:

**  0.9.1 **

* fixed an error that prevented recursive listing from working

* added the ability to configure HJB's runtime system parameters from
the java servlet config XML file

* added the /collect command (Collect From) for consumers and
subscribers.  This allows clients to collect several messages from HJB
in one HTTP request

* changed the output of the /list commands so that it looks more like
the output of 'ls -lR' when recursively listing

** 0.9.0 **

* started recording the creation time of the JMS objects created by
HJB for use in listing reports

* added the ability to list JMS sessions, connections, connection
factories and providers

* JMS connection errors are written to a unique log file per JMS connection

* added an /errors command for JMS connections to allow clients to
retrieve the JMS connection error logs

* the large HJBConnection class has been refactored, all session
handling has been moved to a new class HJBSession

* major changes are recorded in a changelog which can be accessed
online via the svn repository here:
